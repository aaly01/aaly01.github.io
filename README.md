Comp 20 - Assignment 1

This is a website with an index page that contains a picture of me and two
links to my bio and resume. Everything is validated minus the embeded video
in my bio that I have taken from youtube. I know it is not part of the 
assignment so I've commented it out for use after grading.

I used a few youtube css/html tutorials to get the hang of it. I also used
materials covered in class. I looked at Ming's page source to get an idea
of how everything should look. I have not seen any TAs or talked to anyone
else about this assignment.

I have spent ~5 hours on this assignment.
